# Write Pythonic Code Like a Seasoned Developer Course Materials

One of the special concepts in Python is the idea of writing idiomatic code that is most aligned with the language features and ideals. In Python, we call this idiomatic code Pythonic. While this idea is easy to understand, it turns out to be fairly hard to make concrete.

This course will take you on a tour of over 50 of the more popular and useful code examples demonstrating examples of Pythonic code. In the examples, you'll first see non-Pythonic code and then the more natural Pythonic version.

Topics covered include the expansive use of dictionaries, hacking Python's memory usage via slots, using generators, comprehensions, and generator expressions, creating subsets of collections via slices (all the way to the database) and more. Several of these are Python 3 features so you'll have even more reason to adopt Python 3 for your next project.
