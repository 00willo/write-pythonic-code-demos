 0:01 We are going to write a lot of code in this course. 
0:02 And you want to download it and play with it 
0:04 and experiment with it and so on 
0:07 so of course I am going to put this into a github repository, 
0:10 here you can see github.com/mikeckennedy/write-pythonic-code-demos
0:14 so I recommend that you go out there 
0:17 and star this so you have it as a reference.
