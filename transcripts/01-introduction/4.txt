0:01 Are you brand new to Python? 
0:03 Well this course assumes that you have some basic knowledge 
0:05 on how to create functions, classes, loops, those types of things, 
0:07 and we focus really on the best way to do those. 
0:10 So if you are brand new to Python, 
0:12 I recommend you check out my course
0:14 Python Jumpstart By Building Ten Applications 
0:16 and you can find that at talkpython.fm/course.
