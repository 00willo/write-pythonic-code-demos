 0:01 Congratulations, you've made it to the end of the course.
0:04 You've completed over 50 examples contrasting non-Pythonic code 
0:07 with idiomatic Pythonic code.
0:11 I hope you've learned a ton, 
0:13 I hope you have a new appreciation for some of the idioms built into Python, 
0:17 why we use them, what their advantages are 
0:19 and how you can apply them to your apps. 
0:22 The ones you've already built 
0:23 and the ones that you are going to build in the future.
